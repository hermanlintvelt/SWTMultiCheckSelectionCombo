SWTMultiCheckSelectionCombo is a composite similar to the [Combo widget](http://www.eclipse.org/swt/widgets/). It provides a list of check box style options on a floating shell. Users can select multiple options from the list, and the selection is displayed.

The implementation aims to provide an API as similar to the Combo widget's [API](http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fswt%2Fwidgets%2FCombo.html) as possible. The API javadocs can be found [here.](https://lawhcd.github.io/SWTMultiCheckSelectionCombo/)
